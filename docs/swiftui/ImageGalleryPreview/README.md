## Usage

You can pass in an array of Images to the `BPKImageGalleryPreview` and it will display them in a carousel. You can also pass in a `currentIndex` to control which image is displayed and an `onImageClicked` closure to be notified when an image is clicked.

```swift
BPKImageGalleryPreview(
    image: image("London"),
    buttonText: "View Photos",
    onButtonClicked: {
        print("User tapped on image")
    }
)

func image(_ name: String) -> Image {
    Image(name)
        .resizable()
        .aspectRatio(contentMode: .fill)
}
```
